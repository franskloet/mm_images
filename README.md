# images of annotated nematodes/eggs for the nematodes_demo
these images will be used to update an existing mm detector network and ultimately learn to count/predict nematodes, the eggs it hatched from and unhatched eggs


## people involved:

- Noe Germakopoulos Furet
- Julian Evans
- Marc Galland
- Frans van der Kloet

## scripts
- **imageprocess.py** script using the opencv2 image library to preprocess the images
